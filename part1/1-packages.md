# Packages

## From the tour:

- *"Every Go program is made up of packages."*
- *"Programs start running in package main"*
- *"By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path."*

### Examples

Single Import:
``` import "fmt" ```

Multi Import:
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)
```
